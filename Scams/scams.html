                        Scams are attempted and, unfortunately, accomplished, every day in Macon County. These scams originate in foreign countries or distant states, which usually
                        prevents local law enforcement from seeking arrest, prosecution, and restitution. Once the money is gone – it’s typically gone. Scam artists can be very 
                        convincing, and their methods are ever changing. The best advice to follow: Never give personal information (account or PIN numbers, Social Security number, 
                        date of birth) to someone you don’t know. Be cautious in every financial transaction. And never send money to a stranger. If you have questions, are 
                        uncertain, or suspect a scam, please call the ELDER FRAUD HOTLINE at 217-615-7582. All calls are answered by State’s Attorney Diane Couri or Sheriff Jim 
                        Root. Listed below are some of the most common scams we see.

                            Scammers call or email victims advising that they’ve won a large amount of money or a car in a lottery or contest. The victims are directed to pay a “luxury 
                            tax” or a processing fee via a money transfer company or a prepaid debit card, before they can receive their prize. This scam has been around for years, 
                            but continues to bring profits to swindlers. Remember - If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

                                These scammers portray themselves as government employees, telling victims they’ve been selected to receive grant money. Similar to scams telling victims 
                                they’ve won a prize, the callers then direct victims to send payment, which amounts to a small percentage of the “grant,” up front. If you are ever asked 
                                to send money in order to receive money you can rest assured it’s a scam.

                                The victims are offered employment from home. They are directed to open a “business account” in their name at their personal bank, and to provide the

                                money from that account and send certified checks or wire money to certain people in order to help the “employer” with his business transactions.

                                Spoofing is deliberately falsifying the telephone number and/or the name relayed on Caller ID to disguise the identity of the calling party. Scammers 
                                use spoofing to make it appear as though they are calling from law enforcement or other government agencies, your bank, or your credit card company. 
                                Scammers use spoofing to help lend credibility to their lies. Don’t rely on Caller ID as verification of the identity of the person you are speaking 
                                o if you are asked to provide personal information or to send payment.

                                The scammers offer several hundred dollars per week for simply putting a name brand logo on their car and driving around. This fraud can start with 
                                an email, a phone call, or by an advertisement. If the victim agrees, the scammers send them a check in excess of the agreed amount. The victim is 
                                directed to send the excess back via a wire transfer. The checks are fictitious and never clear the bank. The victims will be held responsible for 
                                all the money wired, often to the tune of thousands dollars.

                                The telephone call, which is being recorded, may begin with a brief introduction, but then the caller will ask a seemingly innocuous question such 
                                as "Can you hear me," or "Are you the homeowner," or "Do you pay the household bills?" If you say "yes" the con artists will sign you up for a 
                                product or service. When payment is later demanded your recorded "yes" is used by the scammers to claim that you agreed to the charges. Legal 
                                action is then threatened if payment isn't made.
