                     <p>
                        If you have received a citation for Driving Under the Influence (DUI), the State's Attorney's Office will provide you with an offer of a sentence upon your 
                        plea of guilty. Before an offer is extended you must obtain a DUI evaluation and provide a copy to the State's Attorney's Office DUI Division.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        You are NOT required to accept the offer made to you by the State's Attorney's Office. You have the right to be represented by an attorney. You may either 
                        hire a lawyer of your choice, or, if you cannot afford to do so, you may ask the judge to appoint a lawyer for you.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        The judge is NOT required to agree to the offer made to you, even if you wish to accept it. If the offer is rejected by the judge, you may request additional 
                        time to negotiate a new offer with our office, to hire an attorney, or to have an attorney appointed if you cannot afford one.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        You should schedule your DUI evaluation as soon as possible after receiving the citation. You will be required to give the evaluator a copy of your driving 
                        record and a copy of the Warning to Motorist/Notice of Summary Suspension you received when arrested.

                        A condition of every offer is that you do not drink alcohol or use any other illegal substance during the time that you are on supervision, probation, or 
                        conditional discharge. You may be randomly tested by the Probation Office during your supervision, probation, or conditional discharge period for use of 
                        alcohol and/or drugs.

                                Some sentences include a condition that you participate in the SCRAM Program. This is normally made a condition if the blood alcohol concentration at 
                                the time of your arrest was significantly high or if your criminal history includes multiple alcohol-related offenses. If your offer contains SCRAM 
                                as a condition, you will be required to wear a SCRAM alcohol monitoring ankle bracelet for a specific period of time. The cost of SCRAM is separate 
                                from the fines, fees, and other costs outlined above. If SCRAM is part of your sentence, you will need to contact CAM Systems at (312) 251-7004 in 
                                order to obtain information as to installation of the bracelet and the cost. The costs associated with SCRAM are based on your income.

                        If you are convicted of DUI your driver’s license will be revoked. A revocation will be for at least one year and may be for a longer period. The length 
                        of your revocation is determined by the Illinois Secretary of State and is not controlled by the Court or by the State’s Attorney’s Office. If you have 
                        questions about how long your license will be revoked, you must consult the Secretary of State’s Office or an attorney.

                            Court Supervision is a sentence which will allow you to avoid a conviction for DUI on your record. You will be required to report to the Probation Office, 
                            to obey all orders of the court, and avoid committing any law violations during the term of supervision. If you successfully complete the supervision 
                            period (up to 2 years) the case will be dismissed and you will not have a conviction for DUI on your record. You may be placed on supervision for a DUI 
                            only 1 time in your life. If you have ever received supervision for, or been convicted of, a DUI in Illinois or any other state, you are not eligible for 
                            a sentence of supervision.
